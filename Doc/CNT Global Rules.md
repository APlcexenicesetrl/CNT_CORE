  <h2>âœ¨ Preface âœ¨</h2>
  CNT is a medium between systems and programs, primarily providing system-level APIs for developers and users to better use the device. Therefore, the establishment of CNT global rules is to standardize CNT programs, so that developers can better develop.

  <h2>âœ¨ Start âœ¨</h2>
  CNT is an application that opens the system kernel API to programs, allowing any program based on CNT to call the system kernel without writing a large amount of cold-start code.

Small programs can be developed directly using the CNT Library without depending on CNT_CORE, but as a result, most of the features will be unusable. If you want to use all the features of CNT, you need to develop your program based on CNT Core. To make your program compatible with CNT Core, some rules need to be followed to standardize the structure of CNT programs, maximizing compatibility.

This article will start from the directory structure and explain the basic logic of CNT step by step to ensure maximum compatibility.
